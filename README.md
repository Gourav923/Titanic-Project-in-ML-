# Titanic-Project-in-ML

In this project I use different model to prediction like: 
Gaussian Naive Bayes 
Logistic regression
Linear regression 
Decision tree 
Random forest 
K Nearest Neighbours  

Decision tree has score more than other model  

I also save this model and import in another file using joblib
